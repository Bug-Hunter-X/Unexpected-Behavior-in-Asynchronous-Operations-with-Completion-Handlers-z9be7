This example demonstrates a common issue in asynchronous programming in Swift where the completion handler of an asynchronous operation is not executed on the main thread. The `fetchData` function simulates a network request that takes 2 seconds. The `completion` handler is executed on a background thread. If the completion handler attempts to update UI elements or perform other main thread operations directly, it will lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. The provided solution shows how to properly dispatch the completion handler back to the main thread using `DispatchQueue.main.async`. This ensures that UI updates and other main thread operations are performed safely.
